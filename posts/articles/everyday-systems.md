# The holy trinity

There are three primary tools I use to keep everything organized. These systems are somewhat self-sustaining, meaning that once they are set up they tend to fill a specific need, so there's no conscious effort required to use them.

- **Reminders** for things I need to do
- **Calendars** for things I need to attend
- **Notes** for things I need to reference

## Reminders

Reminders are the best way to offload items from your mental "RAM". Use Siri to create reminders throughout the day. (e.g. "Hey Siri, remind me to DM John in 30 minutes"). Create separate lists in the Reminders app. Assign colors and icons to reinforce the urgency and purpose of each list.

- Near term (day)
- Short term (month)
- Medium term (quarter)
- Long term (year)
- Cycles

### Cycles

Create repeating reminders for things that need to be done at a given interval. Some examples: Finance tasks (1st of every month), Roll bins to curb (Tuesdays at 9pm), Pay gardener (Every four weeks).

## Calendars

Calendars are used for things I want to attend, either physically or virtually.

Use one calendar provider (I prefer Google). Use separate calendars within a single provider, if necessary (Social, Gym, etc). Assign those calendars unique colors to evaluate your upcoming schedule at a glance.

Save birthdays in Contacts. Calendars read Contacts and automatically display them.

## Notes

Notes are useful for keeping track of things that I will likely need to reference later, and are not immediately something I need to complete. Notes can include prose, lists, tables, etc. For example, a few notes I keep:

- Car info: license plate, VIN
- Car insurance: provider, policy number, link to website
- Health insurance: Provider, ID, Group ID
- Freelance: Hours, billed (y/n), paid (y/n)

# Bills

Don't autopay bills. Read each one before paying. Adjust all bill dates to be the 1st of the month.

For one specific cyclical reminder (Finance tasks) I have a Chrome bookmarks folder for all my bills. Right click > Open All on that folder when it's time to pay bills. Pay and close each tab in sequence.

# Email

Aggressively unsubscribe from marketing emails.

You will not miss anything important, I promise. Email should be a peaceful place. I can't emphasize enough how important this step is. I also turn off my email app notification badge because email is usually not urgent so lingering badge numbers can unnecessarily draw my attention.

# Notifications

Aggressively disable notifications entirely, or at the very least manage account preferences such that apps don't send push notifications about promotions.

Try to only receive notifications about time-sensitive, action-required things that are specifically meant for me. I don't want to be bothered by anything that could be construed as marketing.

# Passwords

Use a password manager.

I use 1Password, but anything is better than nothing. Use only one password manager, and disable all other password management (e.g. Chrome, Keychain, etc). Password managers require maintenance, so keep it organized and up to date. Enforce use by requiring yourself to never type login info. If you know an account password, generate a new one and forget it.

Always prefer logging in with Google over creating a new login.

# Profiles

Use Chrome profiles to separate personal and work needs.

Bookmarks, history, cookies etc will all by synced and managed per-profile. For example, gmail.com in my personal profile and gmail.com in my work profile both stay logged in to their respective accounts. Give each profile a distinct theme so they can be easily identified.

Use personal email for personal stuff, and work email for work stuff. You don't want to be locked out of Netflix if you lose your job.

Only use one email address for personal needs. Don't use a spam email.

Set up iMessage to only be send/receive via phone number. The default allows using an email address, which complicates things.

# Autocomplete

Create autocomplete shortcuts:

- email: typing "@@" autocompletes to my email
- phone: typing "##" autocompletes to my phone number
- address: typing my street number autocompletes to my full address

# Routines

- floss daily
- make bed daily
- tidy laundry daily
- wash dishes daily
- work out a few times per week
