As an attempt to further explore the relationship of space and type, I wanted to create an experiment that would use movement inputs to modify the properties of a variable typeface.

My initial objective was to use a phone's gyroscope to control two parameters: tilting left/right would affect slant, and front/back would affect weight. Given time constraints and waning interest in the project, I was ultimately able to use mouse position to modify the weight of the sample text.

The [final output](https://codepen.io/alitorbati/full/BMppEj) wasn't as interesting as I had hoped it would be, but I think the project still has some merit and should be kept around so that future type explorers might use it as an example of what can be done.

I would love to finish this project. I still think it could have interesting implications as variable typefaces allow such fine control over interfaces.
