This sketch was inspired by the idea of interlocking shapes and opposing forces. I wanted to create a system where the user could interact with the shapes and see how they would react to each other.

It also serves as a study in the use of WEBGL in p5.js. Although simple, it incorporates several useful techniques, such as rendering a custom font, positioning shapes in 3D space, and applying 2D sketches to 3D objects.
