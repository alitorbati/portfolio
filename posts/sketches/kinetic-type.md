A quick p5.js sketch that essentially draws some text, then breaks it down into a grid.

We use a few controls to create a spring effect and position an "observation" point over the source text and render it out as kinetic type.

Play around with the sketch to see if you can produce something that suits your aesthetic sensibilities.
