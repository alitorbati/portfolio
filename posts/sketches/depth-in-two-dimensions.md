Sitting around one night I asked myself "How might one convey depth in two dimensions?"

I tackled this project with some succinct, pure JavaScript and no external libraries. All controllable attributes are saved as CSS variables, which are then controlled by a few HTML elements and mouse position.

How would _you_ convey depth in two dimensions?
