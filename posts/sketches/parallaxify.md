While building a microsite for a family member I wanted to include an elegant parallax image effect on scroll. A parallax effect is when an image appears to scroll slightly faster than the rest of the page, producing a subtle shifting/drifting sensation.

I wasn't able to find a simple, reusable solution so I created my own solution and published it for anyone to use.

This little snippet is super-lightweight and requires zero dependencies. I hadn't touched the code in years, but I revisited it for this writeup and really realized how much I've learned. I was able to reduce the lines of codes by 65% (from 55 to 23 lines). The minified version shrunk 59% (from 932 to 374 Bytes).
