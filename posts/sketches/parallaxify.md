![Demo](/images/sketches/parallaxify/demo.gif)

While building a microsite for a family member I wanted to include an elegant parallax image effect on scroll. I wasn't able to find an easy, reusable solution online. I created my own solution, and published it for anyone to use.

This little snippet is super-lightweight and requires zero dependencies. I hadn't touched the code in years, but I revisited it for this writeup and really realized how much I've learned. I was able to reduce the main JavaScript function's lines of codes by 58% from 55 lines to 23 lines. The minified version shrunk 51% from 932 Bytes to 453 Bytes.
