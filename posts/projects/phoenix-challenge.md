During my senior year of college I was chosen to lead a team of students and represent our school at an international packaging design and production competition called Phoenix Challenge. The guidelines were flexible, and we went above and beyond the required scope.

We rebranded Pacific Festival, and designed and produced two food packages and a promotional document for the event. This went from basic concept (what foods are most practical/fun/profitable at a music festival?) to design critique (Which colors best represent our brand?) to technical research (if we choose Design A, can we feasibly produce that design on food-safe materials?). We even created an augmented reality app that would overlay up-to-date concert information on our printed map and in physical space. Check out the video in the Behance project!
