# Spokeo UI Framework

Article coming soon

The complexity in this project came mostly from having to understand the "big picture" of Spokeo\'s aesthetic and determine a hierarchy of design both visually and technically. Many specific implementation details allowed this project to grow without major refactors (e.g: naming on a relative scale instead of an absolute one\: "xl", "xxl" vs "larger", "largest")
