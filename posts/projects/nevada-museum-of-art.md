In early 2021, I was contacted by frequent collaborator [Zeke Wattles](https://zeke.studio) and [ArtCenter College of Design](https://www.artcenter.edu/) professor [Brad Bartlett](http://bradbartlett.com). They invited me to participate in the process of designing and building a microsite for Nevada Museum of Art's upcoming conference: Art + Environment — Land Art: Past, Present, Futures. I was specifically asked to join because of my experience building interactive, generative digital and physical experiences.

## Recognition

This project was featured in [Communication Arts](https://www.commarts.com/project/34606/art-environment-conference) as a noteworthy Art/Design contribution. The project went on to win an [award](https://www.instagram.com/p/CicqGWlu32R/) from the same publication.

## Process

Over several weeks the group met over Zoom to discuss desired outcomes. Since the theme of the exhibit was land art, we wanted to make the user experience reflective of that - to bring site visitors into the land space, instead of leaving them statically in-place behind a screen.

To make the site more expressive and interactive than a traditional website, we employed generative design philosophies - connecting unexpected pairings of inputs and outputs to produce a site unlike any other. Some key details are as follows:

### Windspeed flag

### Perspective text

### Dynamic accents
