# Background

In my senior year at Cal Poly, I took a class investigating the materials and processes required to print electronics. I screen printed electroluminescent and conductive inks on plastic sheets to create circuits that could be connected to batteries.

# Aesthetics

The aesthetics were relatively arbitrary, but there were specific requirements about the placement of conductive nodes and the thickness of the ink. I took the opportunity to not only meet the basic technical requirements, but also incorporate the requirements into an elegant design so that they felt like part of the art, and not an ugly addition.

# Outcomes

In hindsight I regret choosing a violent graphic for this project, but I think the work still merits consideration for its other qualities.

We ultimately used our knowledge to print interactive electronic magazine covers for a major publication.
